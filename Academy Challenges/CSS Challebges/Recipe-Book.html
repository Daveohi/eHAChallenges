        <p>
            <strong>Step 1:</strong>Cook the Meat – In a medium-sized saucepan, boil meat and season with salt and pepper until tender (approximately 30-60 minutes depending on the choice of meat). You can shorten this process in half with a pressure cooker.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong>Cook Tougher Cuts Separately – Boil the cow skin and tripe together or separately until tender; use your best judgment. Remove cow skin tripe and add to the pot of boiled meat. Then add the smoked fish to the pot if using it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong>Reserve enough stock from the meat (about 3-4 cups).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong>Ogbono Paste – Mix ground ogbono with red palm oil, then add to the pot of boiled meat, followed by crayfish and scotch bonnet pepper. Bring to a boil. Then simmer it for 10 minutes or more. Add chicken bouillon or cubes if desired.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong>Adjust Texture and Add Greens – Add more stock or water for the desired thickness. Then add spinach (or other greens), cook for 2-3 minutes more, turn the stove off, and serve piping hot.
